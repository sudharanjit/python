# In this exercise, you will need to add numbers and strings to the correct lists using the "append" list
# method. You must add the numbers 1,2, and 3 to the "numbers" list, and the words 'hello' and 'world' to
# the strings variable. You will also have to fill in the variable second_name with the second name in the
# names list, using the brackets operator []. Note that the index is zero-based, so if you want to access
# the second item in the list, its index will be 1.

numbers = []
strings = []
names = ["John", "Erica", "Jessica"]

numbers.append(1976)
numbers.append(1977)
numbers.append(1978)

strings.append("My")
strings.append("name")
strings.append("is")
strings.append("ranjit")

second_name = names[1]

print(numbers)
print(strings)
print(names)
print(second_name)
