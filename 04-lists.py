# Lists are very similar to arrays. They can contain any type of variable, and they can contain as many variables
# as you wish. Lists can also be iterated over in a very simple manner. Here is an example of how to build a list.
mylist = []
mylist.append(1)
mylist.append(2)
mylist.append(3)

print(mylist[0])
print(mylist[1])
print(mylist[2])

for x in mylist:
    print(x)
